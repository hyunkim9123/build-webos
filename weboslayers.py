# This implementation introduces next generation build environment for
# Open webOS. The change introduces a mechanism to add additional layers to the
# base ones: oe-core, meta-oe, and meta-webos, and to specify the commits to be
# used for each. mcf now expects the layers to be defined in this file
# (weboslayers.py in the same directory as mcf) as a list of Python data tuples:
#
# webos_layers = [
# ('layer-name', priority, 'URL', 'submission', 'working-dir'),
# ...
# ]
#
# where:
#
# layer-name  = Unique identifier; it represents the layer directory containing
#               conf/layer.conf.
#
# priority    = Integer layer priority as defined by OpenEmbedded. It also
#               specifies the order in which layers are searched for files.
#               Larger values have higher priority. A value of -1 indicates
#               that the entry is not a layer; for example, bitbake.
#
# URL         = The Git repository address for the layer from which to clone.
#               A value of '' skips the cloning.
#
# submission  = The information used by Git to checkout and identify the precise
#               content. Submission values could be "branch=<name>" and
#               "commit=<id>" or "tag=<tag>". Omitted branch information means
#               only that "master" will be used as the name of the local
#               branch. Omitted commit or tag means origin/HEAD will be checked
#               out (which might NOT be origin/master, although
#               it usually is).
#
# working-dir = Alternative directory for the layer.
#
# The name of the distribution is also defined in this file
# along with a list of the valid MACHINE-s
#

Distribution = "webos"

# Supported MACHINE-s
Machines = ['qemux86', 'qemuarm', 'raspberrypi2']

# github.com/openembedded repositories are read-only mirrors of the authoritative
# repositories on git.openembedded.org
